# SECT Global Community
*We're late... but iconic.* 😎


> *We pulled up late to GitHub, but we brought snacks, sass, and source code.*  
> Welcome to the **Society of Engineering & Computer Technology** — where the only thing more chaotic than our commit history is our group chat. 😌

Born as an open-source cult (jk... kinda).  
Now? We’re a full-blown **global tech fam™️** helping students build, learn & vibe louder than their Wi-Fi.

## 🌟 The Vibe Check

**Society of Engineering & Computer Technology** — where broken code meets unbroken dreams.

We're not just another tech community. We're that friend who actually replies to your 2am debugging texts, teaches you React without judgment, and hyps you up when your first PR gets merged. 

*Current status: Building the future, one commit at a time.*

## 🎪 Join the Circus

**Perfect for:**
- CS students tired of theory-only education
- Career switchers ready to switch it up
- Devs who want to build something real
- Anyone curious enough to try

**Not perfect for:**
- People who think Stack Overflow is a dating app
- Those allergic to learning
- Gatekeepers (we don't do that here)
