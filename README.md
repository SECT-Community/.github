## 🌟 The Vibe Check

**Society of Engineering & Computer Technology** — where broken code meets unbroken dreams.

We're not just another tech community. We're that friend who actually replies to your 2am debugging texts, teaches you React without judgment, and hyps you up when your first PR gets merged. 

*Current status: Building the future, one commit at a time.*

### 💡 **What We're Cooking**
- Global hackathons (prizes included, obviously)
- Mentorship that goes beyond "just Google it"
- Open source contributions that matter
- Career guidance from people who've been there
